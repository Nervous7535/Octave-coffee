  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 9, 2025</p>

  <p>We take your privacy as seriously as we take our pour-overs. The Octave Coffee app is designed to function completely offline and does not collect or store any personal data.</p>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <p>Absolutely nothing. No names, no emails, no device IDs. Octave is too lazy to track you.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All calculations (like coffee-to-water ratios) happen on your device. We don’t store anything in the cloud or transmit any information anywhere.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This app does not use any third-party services, SDKs, analytics, or advertising tools.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Octave app is safe for all ages and does not knowingly collect information from anyone, including children under 13.</p>

  <p>That’s it. No fine print. Just coffee.</p>
