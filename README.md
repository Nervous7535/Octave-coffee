# 🐾 Octave Coffee – Precision Brewing, Pixelated

Welcome to the official repo for **Octave Coffee**, the sassiest pour-over guide in the App Store. Octave is a grumpy pixel cat who teaches you how to brew perfect coffee—no pods, no posers, just grams, bloom, and pride.

## ☕ What It Does

- Choose your cup count and strength
- Get exact coffee-to-water ratios
- Follow a gamified brew guide (with animations and timers)
- No account, no data collection, no fluff

> “If you want fast, soulless coffee... this isn’t for you.” – Octave
